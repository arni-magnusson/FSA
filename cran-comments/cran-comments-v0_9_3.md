* This updates the existing FSA package on CRAN, fixing notes and "additional issues" (as brought to my attention by Prof. Ripley on 15-Feb-22).

## Notes
* There may be a note about "fishR" being misspelled in the description. This is not a misspelling.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- old-release, release, and development.
* Mac Builder
* GitHub Action (R-CMD-check.yaml)
